# Implement F-1 score as objective function
This project focuses on designing and implementing a novel approach to optimize machine learning models using the F-1 score as the objective function, addressing the challenges posed by its discrete nature. This method will be referred as 'F1 method' throughout the project and documents for clarity purposes.

## Description
This project focuses on designing and implementing a novel approach to optimize machine learning models using the F-1 score as the objective function, addressing the challenges posed by its discrete nature. By leveraging the F-1 score, the method ensures a balanced trade-off between recall and precision, making it particularly suitable for imbalanced datasets. This approach was tested across multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Adaboost, using different kind of data set. The results have demonstrated that this method has measurable improvements in performance metrics compared to traditional cross-entropy-based methods.

However, some challenging parts are yet to be addressed. Possible improvements will be included at the **Limitations and Future Improvement** section. 

I use this platform to share what I’ve achieved and to explore challenges I’m still working to solve. I’m always open to feedback and collaboration—feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss ways to improve my projects together!
